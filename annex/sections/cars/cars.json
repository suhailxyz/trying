    "description": "The 2016 Scion iM was a compact hatchback built on the same platform as the international Toyota Auris. Scion’s last model year before the brand was folded back into Toyota, the iM offered a practical five-door layout, a straightforward interior, and Toyota reliability with a bit of Scion’s youth-oriented styling. Nothing flashy—just a solid daily driver.",
