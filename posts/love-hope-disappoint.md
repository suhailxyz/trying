## Lately I find myself stewing, thinking hopeless thoughts about the world as I move through it. But I’ve started to feel that I owe my own growth to the things I do still love about that world, to the people I’ve grown fond of, to myself.

In these moments I feel rage, a sense of shame, a notion of “I told you so.” It’s a process that I continue to learn. That hope is a marathon, and empathy, even towards myself, is a labor of love that never ends.

It takes a toll on oneself to have sighted such evils approaching, before they manifested themselves into our communities with the brutality on display today. To think about where my actions fell short, where my inaction had consequences, where my silence was heard. It truly weighs on me. But ruminating only accelerates my exhaustion. It belittles the only self I have to give.

I wonder if the sense of safety I get from the rejection of perspectives I believe to be incongruent with my own is just my ego—pride manifesting into a sense of superiority. Even if that feeling costs me hope. Even when it furthers a narrative of irreparability. Individualism festers.

Whether intentional or not, this cycle plays a part in keeping the very systems of power that I despise running smoothly. To turn myself against people I share community with is ultimately capitulation, is it not? How can I commit to liberation if I alienate myself and others by virtue of my own righteousness?

Then again, it’s complicated. Tolerating intolerance is undeniably a concession in its own right. In an effort to accommodate, we often surrender parts of ourselves. A line not to be crossed must be drawn somewhere by us all. Sometimes I think in allegories —

A brutish pig, no stranger to abundance, first demands the wiry hen’s food. Ungrateful, he then insists on taking shelter in her coop. He tells her to oink and rid herself of her feathers. Nevertheless, the oinking, featherless hen isn’t a pig. So he eats her too. The sheep stand by cheering, with their wool dyed pink, oinking.

Why should she have shared even a grain? Why should she have forfeited even an inch? Why must she deconstruct herself in the face of her oppressor? How are those next in line so blind to their own struggle?

I don’t know.

Meanwhile, endless feeds beaming atrocious displays of inhumanity cast a decidedly necessary light on the terror blighting communities across this country. This visibility has a price, though. I’ve begun to worry that I’m left somewhat blind to the gears of oppression turning in my own backyard.

What does my police chief think of ICE? Will they cooperate? What has my representative done in response? Is the mayor taking a stand? With which neighbors can I form a coalition? What do I do if it happens in front of me? Will I be a bystander? How can I be useful to my community?

These questions regarding the world that surrounds me, a smaller world, have found a new home at the forefront of my mind. I realize, as I spent myself on federal government-sized questions, I had missed calls from home. I’ve come to learn that the change we desperately need isn’t coming from the White House. It will come from your library, my mosque, a city hall meeting, a town festivity. It can and must come from each and every one of us. I now see that whatever little I can give to my community, I owe.

It’s hard to make sense of it all, but somehow I arrive at this. Empathy and rage are not incompatible. To feel love and to be disappointed were never mutually exclusive. To maintain your capacity for hope is to resist. So we must resist.

Give what you can, take what you are owed, protect your hope. Fuck ICE.
